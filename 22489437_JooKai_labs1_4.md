## Lab 1: Introduction & Setup

### Section 1: Creation of AWS Account

1. Navigate to https://489389878001.signin.aws.amazon.com/console and login using the provided username and password, changing the password to a secure one on login.

2. Navigate to the security credentials tab within IAM. Here, the user can view their details such as their ARN and canonical ID.

3. Select the option to create an access key for access to programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS CLI.

4. Select the option for use with the command line interface (CLI)

5. Give the access key a meaningful description tag. This will be useful in the event that you create multiple access keys. The tag should describe the purpose of the key and where it will be used.

6. Once the key has been successfully created, download the access key and secret access key in the .csv file and store it securely. If the key is not stored securely, any user with access to the key can use it to create and use resources associated with your account. For privacy purposes, the key is censored in this image.

### Section 2: VM Setup 

The Ubuntu virtual machine was already setup prior to the commencement of this unit. The specifications can be found in the attached image.

### Section 3: Software Setup

1. Python 3.10.6 and pip3 were already installed on the machine prior to the commencement of the unit.

2. The AWS CLI was installed and configured using the access key generated as part of step 6 in section 1

3. Boto3 was installed as per the instructions. Boto3 is the AWS SDK for python and it provides a python API for AWS infrastructure services.

### Section 4: Exploring and testing the environment 

1. Running the command `aws ec2 describe-regions --output table` is used to retrieve information about the available AWS regions for the EC2 service and display the output in a tabular format. The output of the command is shown below:

2. We can retrieve similar information using Python3 by running the following commands. This returns and prints the same data as before. However, this data is not tabulated.
```
python3
>>> import boto3
>>> ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
>>> response = ec2.describe_regions()
>>> print(response)
```
![python method](https://github.com/Bsubs/CITS5503-Cloud-Computing/blob/main/lab1/Screenshot%202023-08-03%20211626.jpg)

3. The following code allows us to tabulate the data and print out only the columns containing the endpoint and RegionName:
```
import boto3

# Get the region data from boto3
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
response = ec2.describe_regions()

# Print the header for the columns
print(f"{'Endpoint':<40} {'RegionName'}")

# Print each region's endpoint and region name
for region in response['Regions']:
    print(f"{region['Endpoint']:<40} {region['RegionName']}")
```
The execution of this code (stored in a filed named cits5503_lab1.py) is shown below:
