5. Give the access key a meaningful description tag. This will be useful in the event that you create multiple access keys. The tag should describe the purpose of the key and where it will be used.

6. Once the key has been successfully created, download the access key and secret access key in the .csv file and store it securely. If the key is not stored securely, any user with access to the key can use it to create and use resources associated with your account. For privacy purposes, the key is censored in this image.
